# Movies ETL

The purpose of this challenge was to extract, transfer, and load movies data from multiple sources into a clean database. Data was processed using Python. Each individual data file was cleaned, non-movies were filtered out, similar columns were merged, duplicate rows were dropped, columns with null values were dropped, data was converted to strings to be able to use regular expressions to match elements and parse data to further clean, DataFrames were merged, and the optimal data column of duplicates was chosen and kept, and finally data was imported to a SQL Database.
